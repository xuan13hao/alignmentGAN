I have trained a Word2Vec model using Gensim 3.8.0. Later I tried to use the pretrained model using Gensim 4.0.o on GCP. I used the following code:

model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(wv_path, binary= False)
words = model.wv.vocab.keys()
self.word2vec = {word:model.wv[word]%EMBEDDING_DIM for word in words}
I was getting error that "model.mv" has been removed from Gensim 4.0.0. Then I used the following code:

model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(wv_path, binary= False)
words = model.vocab.keys()
word2vec = {word:model[word]%EMBEDDING_DIM for word in words}
